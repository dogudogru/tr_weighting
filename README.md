<h3 align="center">Before performing monthly survey data analysis, weighting is necessary to ensure that the sample distribution is similar to the population distribution and that the survey data becomes more meaningful. This app assigns a weight to each person using gender, age group, education and political party preferences of participants in 2018. Tables and charts are prepared with the weights obtained. </h3>
